Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Dear reader,</p><p>Thank you for being here with our project, a celebration and collection of alt text selfies.</p><p>Alt text selfie is an open term. Our understanding of what an alt text selfie might be is always shifting and changing. Selfies and self-descriptions are often visually focused, but, to us, an alt text selfie doesn't need to center around visuals, or literally describe an image. As the selfies gathered in this book exemplify, alt text selfies can blend smell, taste, touch, sound, and more. At their core, alt text selfies are an access practice, tools for connecting across sensory experiences and distance.</p><p>The chapbook is organized as follows: thirty selfies, two essays, and contributor bios. We wanted the chapbook to be selfie-forward. There are birthday selfies, sexy mirror selfies, selfies written collaboratively, memory selfies,<strong> </strong>landscape selfies. Selfies that play with colour, smell, emotions, textures, time. Two essays are included at the end of the chapbook. Thomas Reid writes about the importance of self-description. Andrew Leland writes about disabled self-portraiture.</p><p>Below, we’ve included reflections from each of us about our relationship to this project, to give a bit more context about how and why this project came to be. We’ve also included a short note about our process and our own alt text selfies.</p><p>We hope you enjoy this alt text experiment!</p><p>💖</p><p>Olivia</p><p>Bojana</p><p>Finnegan</p>"},"id":"9d1378bd-3288-47b7-bc8c-ad7f77331202","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Reflections from each of us"},"id":"27849e8b-e8ee-42c3-8240-331ef9d5bccb","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>I (Olivia) was interested in alt text as small, contained micro-stories, often about disabled life (joy, pain, sleep). I noticed that the descriptions would inject a narrative into the image that I would have never been able to access. Alt text is a special meeting place between conventional image captions and disability writing. If Bojana and Finnegan saw alt text as a kind of poetry, I was seeing alt text as a kind of post-Internet literature, one that had been sadly overlooked. Writers were working with emails, chat logs, sms, tweets, screenshots, emoticons, Facebook posts, and so on, but I wasn’t seeing anything being done with alt text! Where was alt text? I also believe that writing image descriptions is a good exercise: it makes you sit with a specific moment and challenges you to translate that into words. What I appreciate about alt text selfies, more specifically, is that they give me richer language to understand my imperceptibly unwell body, to talk about disabled feelings, disabled time, and other concepts which aren’t necessarily visual.</p><p>— Olivia</p>"},"id":"84ad6144-7f07-4374-b3fa-bdb312088e10","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<p>I (Bojana) come to this project weaving two parts of myself into it. As a blind artist and activist, I have been driven to create and find new approaches to accessibility. For me, this has meant collaborating on projects like this, which is a vibrating revelry of creativity and collaboration. I was most drawn to seeking out the descriptions which evoked a visceral reaction in me. To provide more context, at the beginning of this project, I had enough vision to zoom in a great amount and be able to gather the visual essence of someone in a photo. As I’ve started to lose more of my vision these past couple months, I find the part I struggle with most is not being able to see friends and loved ones' faces. I have these moments of feeling like I’m falling as I look at my brother, or my own face. Then, just as quickly, I come back to myself and hear a voice, feel a hand, smell a slight musk, and someone makes me belly laugh. This is what the project represents to me. It’s a way of knowing someone other than seeing. This project also begs the question, how much are we missing by just looking? In the pages ahead, you will get to know several individuals in ways you would not have, had we just put together a collection of selfie images. These selfies have been carefully chosen to reflect what we have noticed as transformative ways of using alt text. Please enjoy.</p><p>— Bojana</p>"},"id":"9ddea8cd-2243-489b-ad15-852dac02058f","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<p>For me (Finnegan), I tuned into other people’s self-descriptions because I often struggle to describe myself. I’m a newishly out trans person and I love being in the current uncertainty and chaos of my gender. But I sometimes ask myself: How do I put this giant tangle into a sweet quip in the alt text of a selfie that is mostly about my birthday, or being on the beach, or my new hat? And, do I even want my gender to be legible in that way? Who do I want perceiving me, and how?</p><p>Through luck and social media, I came across Nicole Erin Morse’s book <em>Selfie Aesthetics: Seeing Trans Feminist Futures in Self-Representation Art</em>. Morse writes about images, but there are big parallels to written self-representations. I want to share a couple of passages from the prologue and introduction of the book that I found particularly interesting in connection to this project. I’ve included the original passage, and a rewrite which de-centers the visual, and points to how these passages might help understand alt text selfies.</p><p>p. 1 </p><p>“Selfies are usually assumed to make a simple and individualistic claim: ‘I am.’ … As trans cinema studies scholar Eliza Steinbock writes, building on Paul Frosh’s research, selfies express an intersubjective, mutual act of recognition: ‘I see you showing me you.’”  </p><p>→→→ I witness you, revealing to me, some of you. </p><p>p. 3 </p><p>“The image itself doesn’t entirely control how it is interpreted; the viewer—and their biases, fears, allegiances, and commitments—is critical to producing the image’s meaning.” </p><p>→→→ The alt text itself doesn’t entirely control how it is interpreted; the reader—and their biases, fears, allegiances, and commitments—is critical to producing the alt text’s meaning.</p><p>p. xii </p><p>“… selfies express <em>and create </em>complicated relationships to the self and to others …”</p><p>→→→ … alt text selfies express <em>and create </em>complicated relationships to the self and to others …</p><p>p. 17 “I argue that selfies can contribute to an ‘undercommons’ of resistant knowledge production and circulation, depending in part on how they are created—and how they are read.”</p><p>→→→ I argue that alt text selfies can contribute to an ‘undercommons’ of resistant knowledge production and circulation, depending in part on how they are created—and how they are read.</p><p>In this book, I hope you get a taste of the collaborative self-creation that goes into both creating and reading alt text selfies. I find it a great pleasure and responsibility and I hope you do too. </p><p>— Finnegan</p>"},"id":"c9ab67ae-9396-4490-b44a-4b136e15ee2d","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Our process"},"id":"b23fe473-02e8-4e36-8484-2bb33efd0ed9","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>This project started when we connected through Olivia’s podcast. Olivia suggested a collection of alt text selfies and, well, here we are now! We wanted to cast a wide net for selfies, so we held an open call. We also reached out to friends/colleagues/internet crushes, soliciting selfies from them.</p><p>From the 100+ descriptions we received (all of which are featured on AltTextSelfies.net), we knew we could only fit thirty in our chapbook. In narrowing down the submissions, our focus was on including a variety of styles, approaches, and perspectives. We each compiled a list of our thirty favourites, then organized them to see if there were overlaps, and automatically moved those into our final selection. From this selection, we each chose our top six. Finnegan plotted these into an Excel spreadsheet, sorting them into different vibes: narrative, funny, word economy, multi-sensory, sexy, objects, movement, nature, lush description, fashion, smell, animals, collaborative, disabled body, emotions, gender play. We wanted to better understand what an alt text selfie could be.</p><p>As with any selection process, we all felt some heartbreak around the abundance of wonderful selfies and our limited publishing space. But our hope is that this is just a start, that the future holds many more celebrations and publications of alt text, in all its varied and delightful forms.</p>"},"id":"fe046c10-579a-47c8-a4d8-3b587f799bfd","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
